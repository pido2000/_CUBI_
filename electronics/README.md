### cubi_board

Recent schematics and pcbs which integrates all the components on a standalone board in order to reduce manufacturing costs.
The board contains a ÂµC (STM32F103CBT6), a hc-05 Bluetooth module, some voltage regulators... However, the GY-85 imu module is not integrated directly on the board.

All revisions used Eagle EDA except the last revision (rev. 8) designed on EasyEDA.

### maple-mini_board

Old schematics and pcbs using Maple Mini boards, mostly developed on Eagle EDA.

### remake_board

Recent tests made on CUBI electronic boards.

The goal was to separate the motor driver and the 9V to 5V voltage regulator (the supply part) from the rest of components.
We wanted to add magnetic connectors (Pogo conn) to have a Plug And Play device.
